Extraction


We used 4 datasets from the DataVic website which is Victoria’s open data platform
https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/organization/vicroads

DataVic is the place to discover and access Victorian Government open data.

DataVic is owned by the State Government of Victoria, and is administered by the 
Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet.

The DataVic Access Policy was endorsed by the Victorian Government in August 2012
for implementation throughout the Victorian public service

In particular we used data sets from the ‘Crash Stats’ suite of data. In particular
the following data sets
